# README Generator
## Description
As a coder, I know how important it is to have a quality README. However, it is daunting and time-consuming sometimes to write a README. As a result, README Generator is created. This command-line application allows project creators to start a README quickly and easily so that they can have more time working on their projects. 
## Installation
The app needs some dependences. See the repo for more information
## Usage
Users will be asked to enter neccesary information for a README. Then a README will be created with inserted inputs. Users can also modify or update their README directly on newly made README.
